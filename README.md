# Hello! Media Guide

Our beloved Hello! Project members appear on their fair share of programming (not enough for some of us, but that's besides the point). But with sheer amount of variety shows out there, it's really hard to keep track of which member is on what show promoting what.

Hello! Media Guide was created to solve that.

Much like TV Guide, H!MG provides a user-contributed calendar of events for which Hello! Project members appear on what _variety shows_ at what _time_ and on what _channel_. This comes in handy only for the Japan-locals you say? I say nay. [KeyholeTV](http://www.v2p.jp/video/) was created for expatriates and foreigners to get their share of Japanese television.
